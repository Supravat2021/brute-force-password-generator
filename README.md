- ✅ Lowercase letters (a–z)
- ✅ Numbers (0–9)
- ✅ Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+[]{}|;:,.<>?/)

This tool is ideal for:

- Password strength testing  
- Penetration testing  
- Cybersecurity training and research

## ⚠️ WARNING: Exponential Generation

This tool uses **brute-force logic** to generate every possible combination.
The number of passwords **grows rapidly** as length increases:

| Password Length | Approx. Combinations |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| 2               | \~9,000              |
| 3               | \~850,000            |
| 4               | \~81 million         |
| 5               | \~7+ billion ⚠️      |

### ❗ Use Responsibly

* For **educational and ethical** purposes only
* Avoid large lengths unless you're **saving to file only**
* Large outputs may **crash your system** if printed to terminal

## 📁 Output File

All generated passwords will be saved to:

```
password_list.txt
```
